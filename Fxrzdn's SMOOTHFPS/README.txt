How to use SMOOTHFPS

1. Adding to Roblox

Roblox has a cap of 60 fps, which is very unsmooth, especially in 2023, SMOOTHFPS can remove that cap. To add SMOOTHFPS to roblox, go in the SMOOTHFPS folder, copy ClientSettings, rightclick Roblox Player, click Open File Location, and then paste the ClientSettings folder.

2. Removing SMOOTHFPS

If you ever want to reverse adding the addon, you can rightclick Roblox Player, Open File Location, and delete the ClientSettings folder.

3. Roblox updated and SMOOTHFPS seems to be gone?

Roblox updates and doesnt keep files in the version folder, mainly because SMOOTHFPS isn't on their servers. Simply, follow the same instructions as shown in the first part.

4. How does this work?

It's a JSON that modifies Roblox to uncap the fps.
